Sea god

"Only if your are able to find a new vessel"

Captain

"But this ship has been my life. How can I abandon it, even if it is no longer the same?"

  

Sea god

"That is the paradox you must resolve. Is it the wood and nails you cherish, or something deeper?"

  

Sea god

"Then prove it. Seek a new path, and perhaps Will posbliy redemption follow?."

  

Captain

"How much more do you want from me?"

Sea god 

Are you a different animal, and the same beast?"
