# Story:
You were eternally bound to the ship of theseus, as long as it floats, you will be the captain. you're are in charge of supply runs between 2 coasts in the Aegean Sea. You cannot leave the vessel, for as long as the ship exists (i.e. the same) you cannot leave. While completing your voyage you must debate with gods to earn your freedom. By the end you should be able to convince the god to free you as you had done so many repairs and are fixing to get a new crew. You argue that with all the changes that the ship is fundamentally different. The gods do not listen to your pleas. Will you convince them regardless?
