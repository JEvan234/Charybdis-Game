# Charybdis-Game Premise
(ka-rib-dis)
This is the active repository of the Fall 2025 KSU Paradox Game Jam.
Screen size = 1280 x 960
## Gameplay:
The goal of this game is for you to play as Theseus, taking turns between combat and ship management. If you can survive 3 combat encounters, you complete the game. Your focus is the ship and its health, if the ship sinks, you lose.
## Story:
You were eternally bound to the ship of theseus, as long as it floats, you will be the captain. you're are in charge of supply runs between 2 coasts in the Aegean Sea. You cannot leave the vessel, for as long as the ship exists (i.e. the same) you cannot leave. While completing your voyage you must debate with gods to earn your freedom. By the end you should be able to convince the god to free you as you had done so many repairs and are fixing to get a new crew. You argue that with all the changes that the ship is fundamentally different. The gods do not listen to your pleas. Will you convince them regardless?

# Game Jam Notes
(V1.0.0 + V1.0.1)
While the pygame framework was fun to work with and gave us alot of control in the souce code, there were many glaring limitations that led to a dimished product for the 1.0.0 Release. These limitations include: <br />
- Lack of support for dynamic assests (animated graphics)
- Requiring external libraries for many advanced features (Such as the need of a dedicated math library)
- Limitations with the Text and Font rendering (Dialogue was rough to implement)
- Limitations with hitboxes (Multiple combat hickups)

While many of these limitations wouldnt have prevented development all together, being under an additional 48 hour time crunch cause these roadblocks to become almost unavoidable.

# Whats Next
We plan to slowly begin on porting the game to a proper game engine (Godot), and creating many of the dynamic assets we wished to use on the jam. With the time limit of the jam no longer affecting us, we might consider removing the hard cap on gameplay time, and presenting some form of endless, or repeatable mode.
